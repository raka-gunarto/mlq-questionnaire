You are more drawn to the question, “what can my life mean?” than to any single answer. You are likely satisfied with your life, generally optimistic, experience feelings of love frequently, and rarely feel depressed or anxious. You may be somewhat active in religious activities, but regardless of your involvement in religion, you are likely to feel that your spirituality is important to you. You place less value on pursuing simple sensory stimulation and pleasure than other people. You are generally certain of, and occasionally forceful regarding, your views and beliefs. Although you could be said to prefer having a stable structure in society and life, you see many areas for improvement to the current situation. People who know you would probably describe you as conscientious, thoughtful, easy to get along with, open to new experiences, and generally easy-going and emotionally stable."

People who know you would probably describe you as liking to play things by ear, or “go with the flow” when it comes to plans. They might find you to be worried on occasion, and not particularly socially active."
